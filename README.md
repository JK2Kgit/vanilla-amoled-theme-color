# Vanilla AMOLED Color Theme
A slightly more colorful Obsidian AMOLED theme for your ultra-dark theme needs!

![Sample screenshot of the Vanilla AMOLED Color theme](sample-screenshot-sm.png)

*This theme was created out of a need for a darker yet vanilla-like Obsidian theme, as well as a theme that takes full advantage of AMOLED screens by pitching the background fully black* - that also has colorful headings.  

Fork of [SakuraIsayeki's Vanilla AMOLED Theme'](https://github.com/SakuraIsayeki/vanilla-amoled-theme), using the same heading colors as [Insanum's Obsidian Nord Theme](https://github.com/insanum/obsidian_nord).
